3. **Add CHANGELOG.md** - Track version history and breaking changes
4. **Add DEPLOYMENT.md** - Document deployment process and infrastructure
5. **Add SECURITY.md** - Define security policy and vulnerability disclosure process
6. **Consider CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - If planning to accept external contributors
